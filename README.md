# FlutterBluetoothStarMicronics
App demonstrating printing to Star Micronics bluetooth printers from Flutter (Android only)

Developed By Gareth Murfin www.garethmurfin.com
This app demonstates printing to Bluetooth Star Micronics printers from
Flutter (Android only). It has only been tested on the SM-T300i Series but most of them
should work since the code is based on the official SDK.
